## Summary
- On Thursday miday orders that were coming from our JWT pizza service failed to reach the pizza factory responsible for producing the JWT tokens. 
- This means that purchases couldn't be made or had strange results during the time
- The connection was down for almost an hour before being restored. 

## Detection 
- The metrics that were measuring the number of pizzas that were ordered, but that ended up failing started to spike.
- An alert ended up being triggered after about ten minutes that the number of failed requests was too high

## Impact
- The total impact of this event was low as only about 2 average users were using the site directly before and during the incident
- The impact could have been much worse, so consider ourselves lucky. 
- All purchases during this time period were not processed correctly, and users now may not know if there money had been spent. 


## Timeline
Times are UTC
- 18:50 : the number of pizza orders that were going through the pizza factory that failed started spiking
    - All requests made to the factory began to fail after this point. 
- 18:58 : the issue was detected and acknowleged
- 19:20 : the issue was fully analyzed and the fix was executed
    - It appeared that part of or all of one more group of requests still failed after this point
- 19:30 : the issue had been fully resolved and no further problems happened

## Response
- Alex recieved the alert and was the first to examine the metrics
- He also identified the problem and launched the solution 
- After this the problem was fully resolved, and orders were being made successfully to the pizza factory. 
- After human eyes verified safe metric levels for 10 minutes the alert level was lowered
- The threshold level for the alert was set up to be lower and added to the workspace

## Root Cause
- The root problem was the loss of the connection to the pizza factory
- To prevent this from happening again faster response is necessary if it goes down
- A live backup for the factory also is a potential worthwhile investment as well
- 
- 

## Resolution
- Our site is now back to running at optimal performance
- All customers who were affected have been contacted, and we have worked to restored 
- The threshold level of several metrics has been adjusted to make sure we are able to find errors before customers do
- In next iteration of the JWT Pizza Factory a request has been made to have a health endpoint made
### Those harmed 
-All users who were purchasing on the site have been informed of this incident, and have been offered aid in verifying the status of their purchases

## Actions for preparation and prevention
- Alerts are to be set to a lower threshold for the number of failed reqeusts to the pizza factory
- Have a potential fallback url that is live ready to act in place of the pizza factory 
- Metric of health of the pizza factory connection to provide earlier warning, this means we detect it rather than customers
