### Combined Summary
Together, we learned that security is more difficult than it seems. Having a secure program means having security measures in every aspect, and the most secure program will be built from the ground up with those measures in mind. And even that program may have exploitable holes, despite our best efforts, so we should be constantly improving our efforts to protect important data. 

It was difficult to find an exploit with our level of skill, despite knowing they exist. That was both heartening and disheartening- good to know there was some basic security already in place, bad that we managed to still find exploits regardless. That is a lesson to keep in mind: we need to be vigilant and be able to rely on others for things we cannot see ourselves.

It is also difficult to keep shortcuts that we leave for programers out of the production enviorment.
